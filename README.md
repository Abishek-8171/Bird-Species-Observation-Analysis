# Bird-Species-Observation-Analysis
In this project, I examine bird diversity in forests and grasslands using a bird observation dataset. By analyzing how environmental factors influence species distribution and behavior, I identify habitat preferences and patterns, providing insights for conservation and biodiversity management.

## Analysis
### Temporal Analysis
Seasonal Trends: To detect bird sightings across different seasons.
Observation Time: To determine a specific time window that correlates with higher bird activity.
### Spatial Analysis
Location Insights: To identify biodiversity hotspots.
Plot-Level Analysis: To identify which plots attract more species or specific kinds of birds.
### Species Analysis
Diversity Metrics: To identify unique species observed and their distribution across Location_Type.
Activity Patterns: To identify the most common activity types (e.g., Singing).
### Environmental Conditions
Weather Correlation: To know how Temperature, Humidity, Sky, and Wind impact observations, such as the number of birds or their distances.
Disturbance Effect: To identify the impact of Disturbance on bird sightings.
### Distance and Behavior
Distance Analysis:  To identify species typically observed closer or farther from the observer.
Flyover Frequency: To detect trends in bird behavior during observation.
### Observer Trends
Observer Bias: To identify which Observer discovers more species.
Visit Patterns: To see how repeated visits affect species count.
### Conservation Insights
Watchlist Trends: To identify trends in species that are at risk or require conservation focus.
AOU Code Patterns: To identify the species with conservation priorities.
### Data Visualization
Interactive visualizations using Plotly in Streamlit
